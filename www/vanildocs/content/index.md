# Build exciting products with vanilla code!

It's _2022_ and modern web APIs reached 95%+ compatibility.
So... why are frameworks, bundlers and transpilers still a thing?
Just because we like complexity so much?

Why not assume that `JSX` is the better `HTML` and fuse it?
Why not have `Node.js` and `Browser` code in one file,
pre-run the `Node.js` code and render the state directly using `JSX`?

Why not transpile any `.js|.jsx|.ts|.tsx|.css` in a
readable way so we don't need source-maps at all?

And when we finally write the resulting code to the disk, why not either `prettify` or `terser` optimize it, depending on if we want to work on code or ship it?

That's Vanil! A pragmatic compiler for the JAMStack era. Vanil helps you to enjoy simplicity, speed and elegance. Think Node.js React, Vue, jQuery, Svelte and Next.js at the same time. It has all the concepts, but no complexity.
